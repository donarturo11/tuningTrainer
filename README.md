# On the program

TuningTrainer is a small and simple program to training tuning systems, recommended for harpsichordists, organists and other who interest in early music.


# Building
```
mkdir build;
cmake ..
make
```

# Run

To run this program correctly be sure that harpsichord.wav is in same directory as file named tuningTrainer.
To run on Linux run at first JACK Audio Connection Kit

For now this program is not tested with Windows, but I'm going to make it cross-platform.
